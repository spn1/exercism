# Solutions for `exercism` Code Challenges
[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is a site that provides coding challenges to developers wanting to learn new languages, practise coding, or brush up on their skills. I enjoy using it when I learn new languages, since it provides a context in which to use what you learn about a particular language. Your solutions are also graded by people experienced with the language (Mentors), who provide alternate ways of solving the problem.
